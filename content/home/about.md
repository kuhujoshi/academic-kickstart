I am a research analyst at <a href="http://www.ifpri.org/profile/kuhu-joshi">IFPRI</a> where I work with <a href="http://www.ifpri.org/profile/avinash-kishore">Dr. Avinash Kishore</a>. I am currently involved in the <a href="https://tarina.tci.cornell.edu/">TARINA project</a> of Cornell University, and an all-India crop variety adoption project funded by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research. I am also studying gender and obesity in India using DHS data.
